                OFunnel is a curated community where every member joins on an invitation only basis. In addition to the score and reputation which tracks the introductions asked and value of the introduction made, you can also check the profile and the requirement of the person asking for introduction. Finally, enough checks are added such that you can send feedback on how the introduction was leveraged and valuable. This ensures that there is enough incentive for professionals to carefully use those introductions and eventual value to the business.

                <span class="col-blue bold italic">What is OFunnel score?</span>
                <br>
                OFunnel score is a representation of your influence and reputation in building and enabling new business value. OFunnel platform takes into account actionable insights such as number of introductions you made vs. taken, how valuable they were and your overall reputation as you take those introductions.
            </p>

            <p class="col-gray-2 font-17">
                <span class="col-blue bold italic">Won't there be too many takers spamming my inbox?</span>
                <br>
                No. You can only ask for this many introductions before you need to give them. And your ability to make introductions strictly depends on requests that others in community send your way.
